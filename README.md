Running :
  We are using sbt. If you have trouble with the dependencies or any general questions,
  contact Ausitn
    > sbt
    > compile
    > run
  
Testing :
  
  We are using scalatest for testing. From the root directory :
    > sbt test
  Should run and compile all test. You can also test within a specific project, 
  or use test-only to call a specific test.

Rules of the Repo :

  - We're going to practice good git etiquette : No branch should live for longer than one week
  - One commit should reflect one logical piece of work
  - Documentation of your style included in any commit (javadocs style preferred)
  - Good-faith effort and having ad hoc testing
  - You should not commit to master something which does not compile
  - You should not commit to master something which fails a test
